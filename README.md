# ðŸ§  Aditi's AI Chatbot Portfolio

This is a **RAG-based Streamlit chatbot** that answers questions about Aditiâ€™s profile, resume, hobbies, projects, skills, and more! Itâ€™s built using:

- `Streamlit` for the frontend
- `LangChain` for orchestration
- `FAISS` as the vectorstore
- `Together AI` for the hosted LLM

You can access the app here: [Portfolio Chatbot](https://aditi-balaji-portfolio-chatbot.streamlit.app/)

Ask about:
- Aditiâ€™s work at NASA, Goldman Sachs, or Linbeck Group
- ML books and tools she recommends
- Her AI/ML projects (GNNs, segmentation, RAG)
- Her singing, dancing, or parody songs ðŸŽ¶

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Documents** (`PDFs`, etc.) were embedded using `SentenceTransformer` and stored in `ChromaDB`.
2. On user query, the top relevant chunks are retrieved from Chroma.
3. These are passed to an LLM via `LangChain RetrievalQA` to generate a contextual response.
